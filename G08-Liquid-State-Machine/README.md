## Project Description:

In this project, we intend to generate a LSTM neural network with the help of keras and tensorflow libraries that can predict the time-price series of stocks in the Nasdaq market.


## what is LSTM in deep learning?

LSTM stands for long short term memory. It is a model or architecture that extends the memory of recurrent neural networks. Typically, recurrent neural networks have ‘short term memory’ in that they use persistent previous information to be used in the current neural network. Essentially, the previous information is used in the present task. That means we do not have a list of all of the previous information available for the neural node.

## dataset:

Our data file is a csv file in which the information inside is separated by commas.
Information in the dataset is available in various Nasdaq markets for 3 consecutive years.

Uploading file in github:
first of all we should have an account on github.
After that we should put project files in repositories .
In order to put the project in repository, we have to fork it.
After the previous step, it is necessary to repatriate Download Fork Locate on your PC (Clone).
And finally upload our project in github!
